						<div>Recently I was using a Node.js library that incorporated EJS and I wondered what factored into the decision to choose that template engine over some of the others.  </div>

						<div>You'll see in the data I collected that I also considered if the template engines were being used in various other popular projects. For example, Handelbars is used by Ghost and EJS is used by Sails. Jade is the default choice for Express. I think that itâ€™s important to consider the ecosystem and how well your work will integrate with the various other tools you select. </div>
